      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Roman Gurung, and I am a Second-Year Computer Science Student in Queen Mary, University of London. I aspire to become a Software Engineer, hoping to earn a placement in a technology field for m penultimate year of university. This website showcases projects I have worked on.</p>

        <h4>Sorting Algorithm Visualiser (personal project)</h4>
        <p>
          I built a web app using React that visualizes sorting algorithms with algorithm selection, 
          input array resizing, and real-time sorting visualisation features. 
          I also designed an interactive and intuitive user interface to make sorting algorithms easy to understand.

        <h4>Weather Application (group project)</h4>
        <p>
          We utilized React JS and OpenWeatherMap's API to develop a reliable platform for airlines. 
          This platform provides up-to-date weather information that supports informed decision-making for flight operations.

        <h4>Issue Reporting Website (group project)</h4>
        <p>I collaborated with a group of 7 to create a full-stack web application for university students. 
          The application allows them to apply for ECs, report issues, and check service statuses. 
          Throughout the project, I communicated with my group about issues I encountered while writing the code, 
          and applied their advice/feedback. I attended all group meetings and stayed organized to ensure the success of the project.</p>
